# Hands-On Web Authentication

## VS Code Launch Scripts
Launch scripts (`.vscode/launch.json`)are available for all the code samples 
from Chapter-1 to 5. 

In Chapter-5, GitHub examples populate the environment variables
 `GH_CLIENT_ID` and `GH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
Similarly, for Google OIDC demo, populate the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and 
`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Due to additional configurations, launch scripts are unavailable for 
integrated sample in Chapter-6 and face match demo in Chapter-7.
